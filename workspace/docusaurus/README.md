# Website1\n\nThis website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.\n\n### Installation\n\n```\n$ yarn\n```\n\n### Local Development\n\n```\n$ yarn start\n```\n\nThis command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.\n\n### Build\n\n```\n$ yarn build\n```\n\nThis command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.\n\n### Deployment\n\nUsing SSH:\n\n```\n$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy\n```\n\nNot using SSH:\n\n```\n$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy\n```\n\nIf you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.\n
